# Recurrent Neural Networks

Normally, a model will have one input and output. However, there are some tasks that one input at current time is not enough information, even with human, we have to combine the decisions to get the final once, and there is a method to do that in Machine Learning. 

The Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is usually used in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem, but we will only focus on computer vision problem, so this article will only contain the image based example.
