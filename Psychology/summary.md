# Psychology

By exploring or observing the brain or how it work, many paper in deep learning area was publiced based on that idea. Therefore, I decide to learn more about our brain, how it is affected by the enviroment, how it decide which is good, is there any task we can apply or open for deep learning or not?

All the knowledge in here is from the course **"Introduction to Psychology"** of Yale University, taught by **Professor Paul Boom**.

**Noted: Since I have neither the experience nor the vocabularies in this field, so maybe the note will have a lot of mistakes**
