# GANs and real life problems

As we know, GANs is a model help we create the new things from nothing, the output from GANs is valuable but it's not real. This article will describe some applicaiton of GANs in real life.

1/ For medicinal applications:
* Dental Crown: fake teeth, or sometime just a part of teeth. To make a crown tooth which means you have to take the sample of the teeth then wait for one or two weeks to create a new tooth. 
$\rightarrow$ GANs can help to generated new 3D crown in one day.
* Generate new dataset for other models
  Remember that GANs will try to generate the new data with same distribution (same patterns) with the dataset. Therefore, train GANs on a same dataset doesn't help to improve the performance of other model.
  $\rightarrow$ We need to meld two or more dataset.
  $\Rightarrow$ Especially in medical, where we can feel free to have new dataset but still not violate the privacy of patients.
